### Why Data Augmentation is Necessary

Data augmentation is a critical step in training deep learning models, especially in the domain of medical imaging, such as ROI mammography dataset. Here's why it's necessary:

- Increase Dataset Size: In many medical imaging tasks, the amount of available labeled data is often limited due to privacy issues, the cost of expert annotation, and the rarity of certain conditions. Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset.
- Reduce Overfitting: By introducing a variety of transformations, data augmentation helps the model generalize better to new, unseen data rather than memorizing the exact details of the training images.
- Improve Model Robustness: Augmentation introduces variability that the model might encounter in real-world scenarios, such as different orientations or scales of the anatomical structures, helping the model to learn to recognize features under varied conditions.
