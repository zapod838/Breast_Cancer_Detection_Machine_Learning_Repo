### To visualize or document the process:

- Create a Flowchart: Visualize the process in a flowchart that shows how data is filtered, grouped, and transformed.
- Write Documentation: Supplement the code with a written document or markdown cells (if using Jupyter notebooks) that describe the overall process and each step.
- Documentation Tools: If you want to share this as a document, you can use tools like Sphinx for Python code documentation which can include both your docstrings and additional explanatory text.
