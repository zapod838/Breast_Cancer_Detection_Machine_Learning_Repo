### To visualize or document the process:

- Create a Flowchart: Visualize the process in a flowchart that shows how data is filtered, grouped, and transformed.
- Write Documentation: Supplement the code with a written document or markdown cells (if using Jupyter notebooks) that describe the overall process and each step.
- Documentation Tools: If you want to share this as a document, you can use tools like Sphinx for Python code documentation which can include both your docstrings and additional explanatory text.
- Create a High-Level Overview: Write a summary or a document that describes the flow of data from the input to the model prediction. This overview can also include why certain choices were made, such as the use of data augmentation or the choice of VGG16 as the base model.
- Model Summary: Use model_1.summary() to generate a summary of the model's architecture which can be shared. This summary will include the structure of the model, the output shapes of each layer, and the number of parameters.
