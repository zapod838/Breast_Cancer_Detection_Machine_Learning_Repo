# RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection

VScode_Tensordashboard_Reactpy_FastAPI_Docker_AWS
- In this project, trained VGG-16 with screening mammograms obtained from regular screening.
- Use Tensordashboard for logging experiments, comapred various error matrics such as F1 score, AUC curve and loss to monitor each models performance.
- Created pipelines for testing 4 different scanned memmograms of single petient to get probability outcomes to detect malignant for cancer or not.
- Created Streamlit basic application to get direct predictions after uploading 4 scanned memograms.

## Next in the agenda.
- Test and finetune different models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNet and Vision Transformers (ViT)
- For application development: Frontend(Reactpy), backened(FastAPI)
- Implementing AWS, Google Cloud Platforms for hosting project
